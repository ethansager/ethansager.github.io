IPA GPRL J-PAL and the World Bank have developed a ton of great resources for best practices in household field surveys and data cleaning. You can find these resources here:
- [IPA](https://data.poverty-action.org/data-cleaning/)
- [Dime Wiki](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data_Management)
- [J-PAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/data-cleaning-and-management)

However these resources are scattered across different platforms and in are mostly in Stata. By translating these best practices into an R package I hope to make it easier for development economists to implement these best practices in their own work. Feel free to make a pull request if you would like to contribute. Find the repository [here](https://github.com/ethansager/fieldwkr)
