  <p class="indie-status">now.txt :: Researching cash transfer effects in Nairobi and subnational aid allocation across Africa.</p>
</div>

I am a master's student in International Development Policy at the McCourt School of Public Policy. My work focuses on impact analysis, econometrics, and beneficiary dignity in development policy.

Previously, I worked as a survey researcher at Gallup and as a monitoring, evaluation, and learning assistant with the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities at the World Resources Institute.

I currently work with Professors Andrew Zeitlin and Billy Jack at Gui2de, Professor Jennifer Tobin at McCourt, and Professor Andrew Dillon at GPRL.
