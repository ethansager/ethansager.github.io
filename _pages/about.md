I’m a masters student in International Development Policy at the McCourt School of Public Policy.

I am interested in impact analysis, econometrics, and beneficiary dignity. Previously, I worked as a survey researcher at Gallup and MEL assistant with the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities at the World Resources Institute.

Currently, I work with Professors Andrew Zietlin and Billy Jack at Gui²de, Professor Jennifer Tobin at McCourt, and Professor Andrew Dillion at GPRL. Researching the effects of cash transfers in Nairobi, subnational allocation of aid in Africa and survey methods in Burkina Fasso.
