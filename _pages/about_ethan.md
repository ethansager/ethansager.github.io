Iâ€™m a masters student in International Development Policy at the McCourt School of Public Policy. 
I am interested in impact analysis, econometrics, and beneficiary dignity. 
Previously, I worked as a survey researcher at Gallup and MEL assistant with the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities at the World Resources Institute. Currently I work with Professors's Andrew Zietlin at $Gui^2de$ and Jennifer Tobin of McCourt researching the effects of cash transfers and the subnational allocation of aid.
