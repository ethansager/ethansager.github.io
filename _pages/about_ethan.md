Iâ€™m a masters student in International Development Policy at the McCourt School of Public Policy. 
I am interested in impact analysis, econometrics, and beneficiary dignity. 
Previously, I worked as a survey researcher at Gallup and MEL assistant with the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities at the World Resources Institute.
